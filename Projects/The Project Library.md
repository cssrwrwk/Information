# The Project Library
The Project Library is a public listing showing all open source begginer friendly projects for begginer to contribute. We restrict and monitor all projects in our public listing. We also make sure that all project are active projects and not inactive and abandoned projects. 

This ideas originally started off from a discussion in a Reddit post. We concerned about how hard to find an active and begginer friendly open source projects so The Project Library was bone. 

The Project Library is founded and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/poetsec">Poetsec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Small-Pig-reporter">Small Pig reporter.
